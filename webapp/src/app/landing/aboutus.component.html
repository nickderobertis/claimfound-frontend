                    <div class="about-content-started-para">In 2014, a close family friend learned that he had an unclaimed life insurance policy in his name, but no idea how to find it. Fast forward more than a year later, countless hours researching, multiple legal consultations, and bureaucratic red tape, he had finally gotten his money.</div>
                    <div class="about-content-started-para">We wondered if there was an easier way and how many people had the same experience? No surprise - there wasn&#x27;t and lots of people. That&#x27;s when we decided to try and make the process easier.</div>
